* __individuals and interactions__ _over processes and tools_
* __working software__ _over comprehensive documentation_
* __customer collaboration__ _over contract negotiation_
* __responding to change__ _over following a plan_

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

####honest software

+++
A guide for honest ways in handling IT projects.

This guide serves all members of a project. The way from feature wish to accepted and shipped product increments is full of pitfalls.
						
We aim on identifying and describing falsyfying factors as well as calling them to awareness.

We feel that __honesty__ means __transparency__, __responsibiility__, __truth__ and an __open set of values__.
