#### the road so far

+++

####traditional ways

* process orientation
* clear tasking
* step by step
* compartmentalization
* foreclosure

+++

####traditional results

* not met requirements
* insufficient resources
* not enough time

####the agile manifesto

+++


* __individuals and interactions__ _over processes and tools_
* __working software__ _over comprehensive documentation_
* __customer collaboration__ _over contract negotiation_
* __responding to change__ _over following a plan_

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

####honest software

+++
A guide for honest ways in handling IT projects.

This guide serves all members of a project. The way from feature wish to accepted and shipped product increments is full of pitfalls.
						
We aim on identifying and describing falsyfying factors as well as calling them to awareness.

We feel that __honesty__ means __transparency__, __responsibiility__, __truth__ and an __open set of values__.

+++

* information reception
* identity
* awareness & knowledge
* communication
* behaviour

---

####information reception

+++

####description

* reception of information has a start and end point.
* the end is defined by an __agreement__ on one common truth by all stakeholders.
* __implicit and explicit__ contents are equally important.
* __interpretation__ is part of the reception of information.
* interpretation will be agreed on by all stakeholders to __not falsify its spirit__.
+++

####practices

* __validation__ of information and its interpretation.
* insist on __completeness__.
* define __together__ what is meant by a piece of information and what is not.
* __do not keep information__. Hidden agendas do not serve transparency.
+++

####pitfalls

* during times of pressure it is easy to let yourself being misled to __knowingly misunderstand information__.
* misunderstand information due to means of __comfort__.
* __Ambiguities__ are likely to be adjusted to ones pleasure.
* Fear of misunderstanding leads to __withholding__.
* Hidden agendas and politics __deny transparency__.

---

####identity

+++

####description

* identity is the foundation of any project.
* objective aspects foster identity as much as __emotional__ ones.
* identity __cannot be forced__ but facilitated.
* is one of the most important requirements for __motivation and performance__.

+++

####practices

* we know who we are. there is exactly one version of our identity and __no necissity to diversify or disguise__.
* the __feelgood__ factor is a valid metric. we will communicate once we do not want to be part of this identity.
* we work with __people and inviduals__, not with ressources. people provide ressources but are recognized as individuals.

+++
	
####pitfalls

* it is easy to __enforce behavioural patterns__. this will not lead to identity but dissafection and abandonment.
* identity is the sum of all participants. hereby it is easy to __damage the identity__ of single participants towards a project by negative influences.

---

####awareness & knowledge

+++

####description

* knowledge about our daily work and the existence of roles and business processes are mandatory for working processes.	
* knowledge about our business domains and processes needs to be educated continuously.	
* we are aware of our actions and their impacts.	

+++
						
####practices

* we do not know everything and do not hesitate __asking__ or __educate__ ourselfs.	
* we do not __commit__ feeling not being informed well enough.	
* we use tools to __gain knowledge__ about what we do.	
* we know when we are done, because we did define it.	
* we know that fiddling with processes has __impacts__.	
* we gain, document, share and evaluate knowledge.	

+++
						
####pitfalls

* the moment something is not clear, there will be __mistakes__.	
* knowledge hidden behind __obstacles__ will not be used.	
* don't kill the messenger.	
* knowledge should be __documented__.	
* it is easy to fall behind on __knowledge and education__.	
* we can never estimate all impacts of our actions.	
* there is no __entitlement on completeness__. it is easy to be satisfied with too less.	

---

####communication

+++

####description

* communication happens over __formal__ and __informal__ channels.	
* a reasonable way of communication assumes that __receivers__ and __channels__ are chosen correctly.	
* communication can be __synchronous__ and __asynchronous__ and has to deal with dependencies on time and content.	
* it is a keyfactor for successful __teamwork__.	

+++

####practices

* standups help to informally offer and get help.	
* status meetings are means of reporting.	
* the less intermediates the less blurry the information gets.	
* since we do not lie, we can rely on what one says.	
* we do not delay. communication can be categorized, there is importance.	

+++

####pitfalls

* __chinese whispers__ can have massive impacts.	
* "that is known anyway" is an irrational assumption.	
* there are no __stupid questions__.	
* chosing the wrong medium or recipients.	
* it is not enough to communicate for its own purpose. those who communicate are responsible for __validation__ of contents and the choice of direct recipients.	

---

####behaviour

+++

####description

* behaviour describes the way we __act__ and __react__.	
* by acting we influence our __environment__ directly.	

+++	
	
####practices

* your mouth is writing checks your ass can't cash.	
* we are not prone to error and aim to __improve constantly__.	
* we do not __pretend__ half arsed jobs to be complete.	
* we estimate realistic scopes.	
* partners are treated the same kind way customers are.	
* our shipments are products __not prototypes__.	
* we use __industry standards__ and __best practices__.	

+++
	
####pitfalls

* reinventing the wheel.	
* forgetting about our partners and vendors.	
* a culture of blame impedes honesty when it comes to errors and mistakes.	
* fear of pressure leads to false estimates.	

---

####the agile manifesto

+++

__individuals and interactions__ _over processes and tools_
_and we have mandatory processes and tools to control how those individuals (we prefer the term resources) interact_

+++

__working software__ _over comprehensive documentation_
_as long as that software is comprehensively documented_

+++

__customer collaboration__ _over contract negotiation_
_within the boundaries of strict contracts, of course, and subject to rigorous change control_
+++

__responding to change__ _over following a plan_
_provided a detailed plan is in place to respond to the change, and it is followed precisely_

+++

* __individuals and interactions__ _over processes and tools_
* __working software__ _over comprehensive documentation_
* __customer collaboration__ _over contract negotiation_
* __responding to change__ _over following a plan_

That is, while the items on the left sound nice in theory, we’re an enterprise company, and there’s no way we’re letting go of the items on the right.
