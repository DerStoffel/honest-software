#### the road so far

+++

####the agile manifesto

+++


* __individuals and interactions__ _over processes and tools_
* __working software__ _over comprehensive documentation_
* __customer collaboration__ _over contract negotiation_
* __responding to change__ _over following a plan_

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

####honest software

+++
A guide for honest ways in handling IT projects.

This guide serves all members of a project. The way from feature wish to accepted and shipped product increments is full of pitfalls.
						
We aim on identifying and describing falsyfying factors as well as calling them to awareness.

We feel that __honesty__ means __transparency__, __responsibiility__, __truth__ and an __open set of values__.

+++

* information reception
* identity
* awareness & knowledge
* communication
* behaviour

---

####information reception

+++

####description

* reception of information has a start and end point.
* the end is defined by an __agreement__ on one common truth by all stakeholders.
* __implicit and explicit__ contents are equally important.
* __interpretation__ is part of the reception of information.
* interpretation will be agreed on by all stakeholders to __not falsify its spirit__.
+++

####practices

* __validation__ of information and its interpretation.
* insist on __completeness__.
* define __together__ what is meant by a piece of information and what is not.
* __do not keep information__. Hidden agendas do not serve transparency.
+++

####pitfalls

* during times of pressure it is easy to let yourself being misled to __knowingly misunderstand information__.
* misunderstand information due to means of __comfort__.
* __Ambiguities__ are likely to be adjusted to ones pleasure.
* Fear of misunderstanding leads to __withholding__.
* Hidden agendas and politics __deny transparency__.

---

####identity

+++

####description

* identity is the foundation of any project.
* objective aspects foster identity as much as __emotional__ ones.
* identity __cannot be forced__ but facilitated.
* is one of the most important requirements for __motivation and performance__.

+++

####practices

* we know who we are. there is exactly one version of our identity and __no necissity to diversify or disguise__.
* the __feelgood__ factor is a valid metric. we will communicate once we do not want to be part of this identity.
* we work with __people and inviduals__, not with ressources. people provide ressources but are recognized as individuals.

+++
	
####pitfalls

* it is easy to __enforce behavioural patterns__. this will not lead to identity but dissafection and abandonment.
* identity is the sum of all participants. hereby it is easy to __damage the identity__ of single participants towards a project by negative influences.

---

####awareness & knowledge

+++

####description

* knowledge about our daily work and the existence of roles and business processes are mandatory for working processes.	
* knowledge about our business domains and processes needs to be educated continuously.	
* we are aware of our actions and their impacts.	

+++
						
####practices

* we do not know everything and do not hesitate <b>asking</b> or <b>educate</b> ourselfs.	
* we do not <b>commit</b> feeling not being informed well enough.	
* we use tools to <b>gain knowledge</b> about what we do.	
* we know when we are done, because we did define it.	
* we know that fiddling with processes has <b>impacts</b>.	
* we gain, document, share and evaluate knowledge.	

+++
						
####pitfalls

* the moment something is not clear, there will be <b>mistakes</b>.	
* knowledge hidden behind <b>obstacles</b> will not be used.	
* don't kill the messenger.	
* knowledge should be <b>documented</b>.	
* it is easy to fall behind on <b>knowledge and education</b>.	
* we can never estimate all impacts of our actions.	
* there is no <b>entitlement on completeness</b>. it is easy to be satisfied with too less.
